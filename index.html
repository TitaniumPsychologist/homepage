            <h2 class="text-center">Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my humble little homepage where I've decided to dump all the links to relevant information to find me and my stuff. Expect really bad coding practices (there's a lot of mess if you open the dev tools for your browser ðŸ˜‰), and my constant struggle with trying to get CSS to work.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
            <p>Hobbyist writer since around 2004, most of it in the form of fanfiction.</p>
            <p>Why am I calling myself TitaniumPsychologist? Well, one day I was studying from one of my psychology textbooks in the kitchen, looked over at one of my titanium pots, and thought to myself, "Yes. That."</p>
            <p>Fandoms that I have written fanfiction for include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Avatar: the Last Airbender, from Nickelodeon
                    </li>
                    <li>Frozen, from Disney</li>
                    <li>Detroit: Become Human, from Quantic Dream</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>However, due to complications, I've since ditched my old account and pseudonym and am now posting stuff under the TitaniumPsychologist moniker.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Social Media</h2>
            <p>For quick updates and occasional glimpses into my head, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ti22psych">Twitter</a>. Includes a general time window for a next update for a fic I'm working on, though no promises that I will adhere to it since I tend to be pretty busy with other stuff lately. My DMs are open!</p>
            <p>For longer updates and occasional "deleted scenes" and my attempts at drawing art, you can find me on <a href="https://titaniumpsychologist.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. Feel free to shoot me an ask or a message if you'd like!
            </p>
            <p>To see the kinds of stuff I like to discuss, you can find me on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/titaniumPsychologist/">Reddit</a>. Again, direct messages are open!</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> I do have DMs enabled on these accounts, however I do have a tendency to block for spam, as well as discussions that veer on the side of NSFW. It's nothing personal, I assure you. I just prefer to keep those kinds of discussions to people I know IRL. Other than that, feel free to say hi!</p>
