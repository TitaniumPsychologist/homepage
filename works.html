I hardly feel anything." Though from the crowd that was gathering around them, Gavin was getting worried. He looked at his forearm and noticed the tear in his leather jacket, bits of his black, long-sleeved shirt peeking through from the damage. There were smudges of blueâ€”</p><p>Blue?</p><p>He yanked his arm out of his jacket and rolled up his sleeve, soaked from a bleeding wound he didn't feel. But instead of blotches of red staining his skin, it was blue. Streaks of it trailed down his hand and onto his fingertips, droplets falling to the floor in dark and vivid circles of sapphire.</p><p>"What the fuck?!" Gavin stepped away from the mess he was making on the floor. "What the fuck is this?"</p><p>"Thirium," Connor said. "Detective Reed, I didn't know you were an android."</p><p>---</p><p>Or, an alternate summary:</p><p>A fic about a human who's bad at being an android, an android who's bad at being human, a human who's bad at being human, and a human who learns what it means to be human. Oh, some of them are family but not, someone's probably dead but not, and existential crises set to a backdrop of a dumpster fire called Trying To Get Humans And Androids To Just Shut Up And Coexist.</p>
